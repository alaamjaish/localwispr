so what i want to build is an app that is going to be like the winds+h thing in windows, or the app wispl flow that transcribes voice to text

the app is like this: i want to wherever I'm typing now, i just click a shortcut, and the app since it is working already in my background of the laptop, pups up and comes to life and starts listening to me to trascribe my text.

the way wispr flow is working is facintating, it just works, i mean i think it needs internet to work, (not sure, search for it), and despite the winds+h to be local and with no internet, i see myself using the wispr flow more, especially bcs its really great, yes slighlty slower, but generally greater expereince, especially since wind+h doesnt support arabic.

the transcription model i want to use is SONIOX, its amaizng, it supports arabic and other languages with teh best accuracy u can ever imagine!

what i imagine is an app that is light and always works inn my backroung, whenever i start my laptop, it starts automatically, and it can be ready to be called from the shortcut.



i dont really know what should i do, how the app will  be, what techstack will you use, this is something that I will leave to u, i want you to discuss with me, discuss everything with me, make me really awawre of what are the options, why each option is like this!

i dont know whether we should use

 this approach: recordd the vioce ==> then send it once done to the api ==> get the transcription at once

or this approach:  the app transcribes live as i speak and i see the words being inputed where i'm writing currently

no idea what to pick, i'll leave it for u to exxplain to me what are both of them doing!


also, notice that i really have no technical background, so in the first phase help me know how the app willl be, what tech to use, etc etc etc.



this is phase one, lets talk about it now!


if u needed to search the web, you are welcome!


for now i needed for windows, but i can see a future where i can easily need it to be on mac, so put this in mind and everytime u make a decision tell me if this can be future proof for mac or only for windows

i have the soniox api

the app shouuld show a smalll pup up, just ike wispr flow does

at some point in the future i might need to store those usages, just like wispr flow, meaning i have a history of what i have transcibed over time, meaning i might need to have an auth in the future

this is for the future, put it in mind, for now i jsut want to make it work bfr i go into this, i just want to amke the basic flow work!
